# NodeSQL
an auction style app for node.js and MySql

To run this program, open it in the text editor of your choice.  You will need to run "npm install" to download the required packages.  This is a node application, so you'll need to open the root folder in the terminal and type "node bamazonCustomer.js" to run it.
